# Tata-Steel-Machine-Failure


Machine Failure Prediction Using XGBoost and Random Forest
This project focuses on predicting machine failures in the steel manufacturing industry to minimize downtime and improve operational efficiency. The dataset used for this project contains operational parameters of machinery used in steel production, including temperature, rotational speed, torque, and tool wear. By applying advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques, we aim to predict potential failures before they occur, enabling proactive maintenance and reducing production losses.

Project Structure:
Data Preprocessing:
Handling missing values, outliers, and data transformation.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualizing data distributions, correlations, and identifying patterns.
Feature Selection:
Dropping irrelevant columns and selecting meaningful features for the model.
Model Building:
Trained multiple models including Random Forest and XGBoost for prediction.
Hyperparameter Tuning:
Performed GridSearchCV for tuning model parameters to enhance performance.
Model Evaluation:
Accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices used to evaluate model performance.
Final Comparison:
Compared the performance of Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models.
Technologies Used:
Python
Pandas, NumPy
